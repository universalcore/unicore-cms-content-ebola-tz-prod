  "content": "While travelers should always be vigilant with regard to their health and those around them, the risk of infection for travelers is very low since person-to-person transmission results from direct contact with the body fluids. As with any illness or disease, it is always possible that a person who has been exposed to Ebola virus may choose to travel. If the individual has not developed symptoms, they cannot transmit Ebola virus to those around them. It is however recommended that people minimize non-essential travel to places that have Ebola. If you have recently been to a place or country that has confirmed Ebola cases you should be aware of the symptoms of infection and seek medical attention at the first sign of illness.\r\n\r\n",
