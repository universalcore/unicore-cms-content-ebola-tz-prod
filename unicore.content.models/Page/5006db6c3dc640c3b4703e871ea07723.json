Listen to and follow directives issued by the Ministry of Health. \r\nIf you suspect someone close to you or in your community of having Ebola virus disease, encourage and support them in seeking appropriate medical treatment in a health-care facility. \r\nWash your hands with water and soap after visiting hospitals or caring for any other patient.\r\nDevelop the habit of washing your hands with clean water and soap regularly, especially before eating or touching food. \r\nAvoid touching your mouth with dirty hands. \r\nAdditionally, individuals should reduce contact with high-risk infected animals (i.e. fruit bats, monkeys or apes) in the affected rainforest areas.\r\n\r\n",
